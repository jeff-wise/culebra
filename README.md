# Culebra

Culebra is a Yaml serialization library for Kotlin built using
the [snakeyaml] library. It provides a flexible interface for
serializing Kotlin values to and from Yaml with the help of the
Applicative / Monadic parsing style. This library is heavily
influenced by [aeson] and pure functional programming methods. 

With Culebra you are not limited to using DTOs. You can design both
the structure of your Yaml files and your Kotlin data types however
you like and serialize directly between the two. The tradeoff is that
you have to write the functions yourself. But it's not that hard, and
if they typecheck, they should behave predictably.
